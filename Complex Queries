-- Complex queries using multiple tables

-- We have 2 tables we want to make queries for
-- Customers (id, name, email)
-- Orders (id, customer_id, item_id, price)

SELECT c.name
FROM (
	SELECT customer_id, AVG(price) AS avg_price 
	FROM Orders
	GROUP BY customer_id
) AS cust_avg
JOIN Customers c ON cust_avg.customer_id = c.id
WHERE cust_avg.avg_price = (
	SELECT MAX(AVG(price))
	FROM Orders
	GROUP BY customer_id
);

-- Returns the name of the customer with the highest average order price
