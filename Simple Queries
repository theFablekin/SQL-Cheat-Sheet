UPDATE Customers
SET email = ‘jane.smith@hotmail.cöm’
WHERE name = ‘Jane Smith’;

DELETE FROM Customers
WHERE name = ‘Jhon Jhonson’;

WHERE price > 50000;

-- Returns the id’s of orders, where the price is higher than 50000

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Orders;

SELECT item_id, AVG(price) AS avg_price

SELECT id, price FROM Orders
ORDER BY price DESC;
